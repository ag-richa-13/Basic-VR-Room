# Basic VR Room – Unity Project

This project is a **minimal template** that demonstrates how to set-up a virtual-reality scene in Unity, place simple furniture (chair & table) in the room, and drive everything with the modern **XR Interaction Toolkit** and **Input System**.

> Tested with **Unity 6.0.0f (Tech-Stream 6000.2.10f1)** on Windows 64-bit. Any recent **Unity 2022 LTS / 2023 LTS** version that supports the same packages should work as well.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

1. **Unity Hub** – install the Editor version mentioned above.
2. **VR Headset & drivers** – e.g. Meta Quest (via Link), HTC Vive, Valve Index, Windows MR…
3. **Graphics API** – DirectX 11 or 12 (default on Windows).

---

## 2. Opening the Project

1. Launch **Unity Hub** → *Open* → select this folder `Basic-VR-Room` (that contains the `Assets`, `Packages`, etc.).
2. Unity will import packages and generate the solution automatically.  Wait until compilation finishes.

---

## 3. Installing VR Support

Unity uses **package-based XR**.  Follow these steps the first time you open the project (or when upgrading Unity):

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
|1|Open **Window ▸ Package Manager** |
|2|Change the drop-down to **Unity Registry** |
|3|Install **XR Interaction Toolkit** ✔ |
|4|Install **Input System** (if not already present) ✔ |
|5|Install **XR Plugin Management** ✔ |
|6|Close Package Manager |

### 3.1 Enable OpenXR runtime

1. **Edit ▸ Project Settings ▸ XR Plug-in Management**.
2. Select **PC, Mac & Linux Standalone** (or your target platform).
3. Tick **OpenXR** provider.
4. In the **OpenXR** tab enable the **Oculus** and/or **Windows Mixed Reality** feature groups according to your headset.
5. Unity may ask to restart – accept.

### 3.2 Switch to Input System

Unity 2020.3+ can run both the old and new input back-ends.  This project already contains an
`InputSystem_Actions.inputactions` asset, so make sure **Edit ▸ Project Settings ▸ Player ▸ Other Settings ▸ Active Input Handling** is set to **Both** or **Input System Package (New)**.

## 4. Project Structure Overview

```
Assets/
 ├─ Material/           # Sample materials (add your own!)
 ├─ Prefab/             # Prefabs for the Chair & Table                ← You place your 3-D models here
 ├─ Scenes/             # Unity scenes.  Create `Room.unity` here.
 ├─ Scripts/
 │   └─ FurnitureSpawner.cs   ← Instantiates the furniture prefabs at runtime
 ├─ XR/                 # Auto-generated by XR Plug-in Management
 └─ XRI/                # XR Interaction Toolkit settings & defaults

 └─ packages-lock.json

## 5. Creating the VR Room Scene

1. **File ▸ New Scene** → *3D (URP/HDRP/BiRP)* → save as `Room.unity` inside `Assets/Scenes`.
2. **GameObjects** to create:
   * *Room_Root* _(empty parent)_ positioned at *(0,0,0)* – this will be the anchor for all room content.
   * *XR Origin (Action-Based)* – via **GameObject ▸ XR ▸ XR Origin (Action-based)**.
   * *Directional Light* – for basic lighting.
3. Drag the **FurnitureSpawner** script onto *Room_Root* and, in the Inspector:
   * Assign **Chair Prefab** (`Assets/Prefab/Chair.prefab`).
   * Assign **Table Prefab** (`Assets/Prefab/Table.prefab`).
   * Set **Room Root** to the *Room_Root* transform.
4. Tweak **chairPosition / tablePosition** & **Rotation** fields if you want to move furniture around.

> Tip: Hold **Ctrl + Shift** and drag your headset/controller in the Scene view to test the furniture placement quickly.

---

## 6. Running in VR

1. Connect your headset (ensure SteamVR / Oculus software is running).
2. Press **Play** in the Unity Editor; the *XR Origin* will take control and you can move around using thumb-sticks.
3. The **FurnitureSpawner** script will instantiate the **Chair** & **Table** inside the room automatically at runtime.

---

## 7. Building the Project

1. **File ▸ Build Settings**.
2. Select your target platform (e.g. *PC, Mac & Linux Standalone*).
3. Click **Add Open Scenes** to include `Room.unity`.
4. Press **Build And Run**.

> For Quest (Android), switch platform to **Android**, enable OpenXR for Android, then build the APK.

---

## 8. Customising Furniture

1. **Create 3-D Models / Prefabs** for additional furniture.
2. Drop them into `Assets/Prefab/`.
3. Update `FurnitureSpawner` with new public `GameObject` references and placement transforms.

```csharp
// Example addition inside FurnitureSpawner
public GameObject lampPrefab;
public Vector3 lampPosition = new Vector3(0,0,2);
public Vector3 lampRotation = Vector3.zero;
```

---

## 9. Version Control Notes

A **Unity-optimised** `.gitignore` is already included to exclude `Library/`, `Logs/`, build artifacts, etc.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
|**No HMD tracking**|Ensure OpenXR runtime is active in SteamVR / Oculus app.|
|**Input doesn’t work**|Re-import `InputSystem_Actions` and check Active Input Handling.|
|**Furniture not visible**|Make sure the prefabs are assigned in *FurnitureSpawner* and their transforms are within the room bounds.|

Happy prototyping & welcome to VR!  🎉
